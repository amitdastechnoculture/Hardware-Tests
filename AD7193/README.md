# AD7193 Arduino Library

The AD7193 is a 24-bit, 4-channel Sigma-Delta ADC with built-in PGA.  More information can be found at http://www.analog.com/ad7193.

The initial release of this library provides a simple set of functions to measure voltage per channel, capable of either differential or psuedo differential voltage measurements.

There are also basic examples to demonstrate differential and psuedo-differential measurement.

Also included is an example that measures voltage on a K-type thermocouple, and reports the resulting temperature.
